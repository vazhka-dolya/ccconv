# In detail
Gameshark cheat codes are different for each region, this means that, for instance, you cannot use a cheat code for the US version in the Japanese version, including colorcodes. ccconv fixes that problem by converting the colorcode's other region's addresses to desired region's addresses (This program is only able to convert colorcodes, it is not possible to do that for every single cheat code).
also please don't bully me for my garbage code i'm new to python

# How to use
It's pretty simple, on the left you insert your colorcode and choose the region it currently has, on the right you choose the region you want to convert your colorcode to. Then you click "Convert" and the converted colorcode appears in the right text area.
